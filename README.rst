Culinary
========

A fork of `Cuisine`_ for those who like namespaces.

Why?
----

Cuisine is a great collection of useful functions for `Fabric`_, but the
philosophy of including everything in one ``cuisine.py`` file has been stretched
too thin. Cuisine is now one massive file that has become unwieldy. The function
naming convention has also resulted in some awkwardly long function names.

Culinary is an attempt to organize the Cuisine API.
